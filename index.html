    <h1>Latest Update | May 14th, 2025</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to Bread Loaf Games! My wife and I have always talked about making our own game that we would love to play and enjoy with friends and family. We are always talking about game ideas, fun concepts, cool features, and art styles. Together, we are going to work on developing our own game! We know it's not easy, but we enjoy learning new things and will use this website as a place to post updates, and hold ourselves accountable. Jan is pregnant and is due late 2025, so updates will be slow; not including us being complete newbies at all things game development so please be patient with us.

    <p>
      Please continue to follow along, try out demos when they are available, and provide feedback once we share some information on the game. We plan to eventually release free demos you can download via this website. Remember, we are learning all of this as we go along with the project. Please be nice and respectful, and once the game is playable, please have lots of fun!
