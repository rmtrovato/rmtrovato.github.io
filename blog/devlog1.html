  <h1>Devlog 1: Getting Started</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the first development log! My wife and I have started work on a game and currently building a website to host all the information. We have also started pre-planning a lot so there will most likely be a bit of time between each update. We are also complete newbies at website/game design so please be nice; we love positive feedback.</p>
